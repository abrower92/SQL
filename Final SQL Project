# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer, employee, and sales data.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerID, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA';

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices AS inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, inv.InvoiceID
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices Inv
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;
